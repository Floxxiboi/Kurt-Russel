This project was made as a school project, it's not good but I am not going to improve it.
It is a standard FPS game.

Download and run in unity.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. 

There is a lot of characterController scripts.

IMPROVEMENT:
Movement script needs to be fixed.
Shooting needs to be fixed, bullets doenst shoot in a straight line, it just falls to the ground.
Pausemenu needs to be fixed, it doesn't work.
Textures on map needs fixes.
Multiplayer needs to be implemented to the game.

Test:
The game is built enough so you can run and shoot.
